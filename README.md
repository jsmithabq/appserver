*appserver*
===========

Summary
-------

A MEAN / Bootstrap / AngularJS / Node.js single-page, tabbed UI, application
server skeleton with core functionality

Overview
--------

AppServer is a skeleton application server that follows the MongoDB, Express,
AngularJS, and Node.js (MEAN) application model, a popular fullstack
JavaScript-based framework suite for web applications.  In comparison to other
web frameworks, Express provides straightforward support for browser and
programmatic RESTful HTTP request/response URL handling, not unlike the
Ruby-based Sinatra framework.  MongoDB and Mongoose provide a database backend
for web services-related persistence that can be more straightforward,
depending on app server requirements, than setting up SQL- and
Ruby/Sequel-based backends.  AngularJs provides frontend web services, while
Node.js provides backend services..
