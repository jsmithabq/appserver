*AppServer*
===========

Summary
-------

A MEAN / Bootstrap / AngularJS / Node.js single-page, tabbed UI, application
server skeleton with core functionality

Overview
--------

AppServer is a skeleton application server that follows the MongoDB, Express,
AngularJS, and Node.js (MEAN) application model, a popular fullstack
JavaScript-based framework suite for web applications.  In comparison to other
web frameworks, Express provides straightforward support for browser and
programmatic RESTful HTTP request/response URL handling, not unlike the
Ruby-based Sinatra framework.  MongoDB and Mongoose provide a database backend
for web services-related persistence that can be more straightforward,
depending on app server requirements, than setting up SQL- and
Ruby/Sequel-based backends.  AngularJs provides frontend web services, while
Node.js provides backend.

AppServer is a skeleton app that provides an example of a MEAN implementation,
but will require modification, as well as domain-related extensions.  AppServer
is not a zero-modification, extensible application.

Angular/Bootstrap Design
------------------------

AppServer implements a custom tabbed main page positioned below a custom
toolbar.  The tabbed design borrows functionality from 
[Hafiz Faraz's Tab Tutorial](http://blog.hfarazm.com/tabs-in-angularjs/).  The
tabs have a minor resemblance to jQuery pills, but aligned visually more like
tabs.  The custom toolbar is a div-based table altenative to a navigation bar.
If an app only requires a series of dropdown menus, that is, homeogeneous
content, the toolbar could be replaced by a navigation bar.  As currently
configured, the custom toolbar supports heterogeneous content, such as the
right-justified real-time UTC time display.  Lastly, AppServer employs
[Greg Franko's SelectBoxIt](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js)
for the demo content within the tabs, but, of course, each tab's contents should
be replaced based on to the requirements of each web application.

Each div-based tabbed panel is defined within a form.  The forms can be
configured for standard HTML processing by setting the button type to "submit",
or remain as is with a button type of "button".  In the latter case, the form
processing is handled through an on-click JavaScript event.

Cascading Style Sheets
----------------------

The rightmost tab, an "Options" tab, includes a select box for style.  AppServer
includes eight Cascading Style Sheets (CSSes) for various color styles.  The
"Preview" button loads the selected style sheet.

CSS styles are handled by setting one primary style sheet from multiple style
sheets, the remaining style sheets set as alternates.

AppServer does not use LESS.  Instead, it defines multiple identical style
sheets, except for the color variations.  Because CSS variables are just now
receiving preliminary support, AppServer employs pseudo CSS variables, defined
near the top of each style sheet:

    ====================
    ...
    "$lgo_fg" : "#732525"
    ...
    =====================


Colors are implemented using a comment-and-RGB-value scheme, for example:

    #logo-a {
      color: /* $lgo_fg */ #732525;
      ...
    }

AppServer includes two 'sub-colors.*' scripts in 'binsh' that search for and
replace each occurrence of the "pseudo color variable following comment" with
the RGB value specified in the pseudo variable definitions.

This scheme will be replaced by CSS variables once they are widely supported.
